## Usage

### Discord requirements

1. Create yourself a bot at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me
2. Manage you bot permission with bot ID at https://discordapi.com/permissions.html
3. Invite the bot in a server that you are manager

### Run locally

```bash
# get in the project directory and open your terminal
npm install
cat database.sql | mysql -u root -p
node server.js
```

then the bot should be online as long as the nodejs server is running, (note) it's really important to hide your bot token or someone could mess with you discord server by using the bot on his own nodejs server

### Run with `docker-compose`

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Invite my bot (nothing required)

Client ID: `321041087689129994`

Manage bot permission then invite the bot in your server at https://discordapi.com/permissions.html

#### Notes

* _You must be server manager to be able to invite bot_
* _My bot is not always online since it's currently in development_
